### **Day 1: Introduction to HTML**

This lesson is designed to introduce beginners to the foundational concepts of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which is the standard markup language used to create web pages. By the end of this lesson, you should have a basic understanding of HTML structure and be able to create a simple webpage.

#### **1. Understand the Structure of an HTML Document**

The structure of an HTML document is like a skeleton that defines the overall framework of a webpage. Here's a breakdown of its essential components:

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>` Declaration:** 
  - This is the document type declaration, which tells the web browser that this is an HTML5 document. It ensures that the document is rendered correctly in all browsers.

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  ```

- **`<html>` Element:**
  - The `<html>` tag is the root element of an HTML page. All other elements are nested within this tag.

  ```html
  <html>
  ...
  </html>
  ```

- **`<head>` Element:**
  - The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character set, stylesheets, and scripts.

  ```html
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  ```

  - **`<meta>` Tags:** Provide metadata, like the character set and description of the page.
  - **`<title>` Tag:** Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.

- **`<body>` Element:**
  - The `<body>` section contains the actual content of the webpage, including text, images, links, and other media.

  ```html
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
  ```

Here's how these elements fit together in a simple HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### **2. Learn About Tags, Elements, and Attributes**

Understanding tags, elements, and attributes is crucial for working with HTML. Let's delve into each:

- **Tags:**
  - Tags are the building blocks of HTML, used to create elements. They are enclosed in angle brackets `< >` and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.

  ```html
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  ```

  - In this example, `<p>` is the opening tag, and `</p>` is the closing tag. Together, they create a paragraph element.

- **Elements:**
  - An element consists of a start tag, its attributes (if any), content, and an end tag. Elements can be nested inside one another.

  ```html
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is a nested paragraph.</p>
  </div>
  ```

  - Here, `<div>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>` are elements. Elements can contain text, other elements, or both.

- **Attributes:**
  - Attributes provide additional information about an element and are always specified in the opening tag. They usually come in name/value pairs like `name="value"`.

  ```html
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
  ```

  - In this example, `src` and `alt` are attributes of the `<img>` element. The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image, and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text if the image cannot be displayed.

#### **3. Practice Creating a Simple Webpage**

This part of the lesson focuses on applying the concepts learned by creating a simple webpage. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

**Step 1: Set Up Your HTML Document**

1. Open a text editor (like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++).
2. Create a new file and save it as `index.html`.

**Step 2: Write the Basic HTML Structure**

Start with the basic HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

**Step 3: Add Content to the `<body>` Section**

Let's add some content to our webpage:

```html
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text that introduces the webpage.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful scenery">
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
</body>
```

- **`<h1>` Tag:** Creates a large heading for the webpage.
- **`<p>` Tag:** Adds a paragraph of text.
- **`<img>` Tag:** Displays an image (make sure `image.jpg` is in the same directory as your HTML file).
- **`<a>` Tag:** Creates a hyperlink to another webpage.

**Step 4: Save and Open Your Webpage**

1. Save your `index.html` file.
2. Open the file in a web browser (you can double-click the file, or right-click and select "Open with [Browser Name]").

**Step 5: Experiment and Customize**

Try experimenting with other elements and attributes:

- **Add More Headings:**

  ```html
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
  ```

- **Lists:**

  ```html
  <ul>
      <li>Reading</li>
      <li>Traveling</li>
      <li>Coding</li>
  </ul>
  ```

- **Text Formatting:**

  ```html
  <p><strong>This is bold text.</strong> <em>This is italic text.</em></p>
  ```
